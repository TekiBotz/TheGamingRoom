# TheGamingRoom

 The client, The Gaming Room, has enlisted Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to develop a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It. The current Android app game involves teams guessing drawings rendered from a stock library. The client wants to expand the game's availability to multiple platforms. The software requirements include the ability to have multiple teams with assigned players, unique game and team names, and a restriction of one game instance in memory at a time. In developing the documentation, I effectively captured the client's requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of the game's functionality. The design document served as a valuable reference, guiding the development process and aligning it with the client's goals. 
 
  The executive summary is one part of my work I would choose to revise, I would expand upon it including more relevant information for busy executives, stakeholders, or decision-makers who may not have the time to read the entire document. To interpret the user's needs, I closely analyzed the requirements and communicated actively with the client. For future software design, techniques like entity-relationship diagrams and architectural patterns would be employed to model relationships and enforce restrictions. Utilizing web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with Node.js and a suitable database for the backend, would be recommended for creating a responsive and multi-platform web-based game application that meets the client's requirements.
